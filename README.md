  - Dynamic threat level indicators
  - Detailed AI-powered security analysis.

- **AI-Powered Analysis**:
  - Ollama integration with llama3.2
  - Real-time threat assessment
  - Detailed security recommendations
  - Context-aware analysis

- **Interactive UI**:
  - Dark/Light mode toggle
  - Modern model selection interface
  - Visual threat level indicators
  - Loading animations

- **Export Functionality**:
  - PDF report generation
  - Detailed threat analysis
  - Downloadable reports

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML5/CSS3
  - JavaScript (Vanilla)
  - Modern UI components
  - Responsive design

- **Backend**:
  - Python
  - Flask web framework
  - PyTorch for deep learning
  - Ollama with Llama3.2 for AI analysis
  - FPDF for report generation

- **Models**:
  - CNN-BiLSTM architecture
  - Attention mechanism implementation
  - Character-level URL tokenization
  - Llama3.2 for contextual threat analysis

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
https://github.com/PawishrajhenAR/MaliciousURLNet.git
cd url-threat-scanner
```

2. Install Ollama and Llama3.2:
   - Follow instructions at https://ollama.ai to install Ollama
   - Pull the Llama3.2 model: `ollama pull llama3.2`

3. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the application:
```bash
python app.py
```

## Usage

1. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:5000`
2. Paste a URL in the input field
3. Select preferred model (With/Without Attention)
4. Click "Check URL Now"
5. View analysis results and export if needed

## How It Works

1. **URL Analysis**:
   - Input URLs are processed through character-level tokenization
   - Deep learning models (CNN-BiLSTM) analyze URL patterns
   - Threat levels are determined based on model predictions

2. **AI-Powered Assessment**:
   - Ollama with Llama3.2 provides detailed threat analysis
   - Context-aware security recommendations
   - Classification-specific insights and warnings
   - Real-time threat level assessment

3. **Report Generation**:
   - Comprehensive PDF reports including:
     - URL analysis results
     - AI-generated security assessment
     - Specific threat indicators
     - Actionable recommendations
